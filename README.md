## üöÄ Usage

1. **Configure API:**
   * After installation and restarting Thonny, you'll see a new `AI` menu in the main menu

   * **API URL:** Enter your AI service endpoint
     * e.g., OpenAI API: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
     * e.g., Local Ollama (default): `http://localhost:11434/api` (please verify your Ollama endpoint)
     * For OpenAI-compatible APIs, usually ends with `/v1`
   * **API Key:** Enter your API key. For local services like Ollama, key may not be required - leave empty or enter any character (like "ollama")

     * Click `Refresh Models` button - the plugin will attempt to fetch model list from your provided API URL
     * After success, select your desired model from the dropdown
